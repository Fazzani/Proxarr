# Proxarr

Proxarr is a simple proxy server that can be used to auto qualify if item media maybe download or not, based on their availability on watching providers in your country. 
It is written in .NET (c#).

## How it works

## TODO

- [ ] CI/CD setup
- [ ] Add more providers (JustWatch, Reelgood, etc)
